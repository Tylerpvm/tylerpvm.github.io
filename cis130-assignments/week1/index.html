            Hey! My name is Tyler and I'm 29 years old. I'm happily married to my beautiful wife, Alisha. We have a 4
            month
            old son named Mikko, who we named after a hockey player from Colorado. We also have 3 cats (Thanos, Oren,
            and
            Chewy) and 1 dog (Anakin)!
        </p>
        <p>
            Currently, the only CIS classes I have taken are CIS 101 and CIS 120 but I have most of my electives done.
