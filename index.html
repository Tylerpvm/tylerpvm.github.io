                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>Hi There! Thanks for stopping by to check out my online profile! I'll start off by introducing
                    myself. My name is Tyler and I'm from Springfield Missouri. My dad's side of the family is from
                    Missouri but my mom comes from Denver Colorado. I love my home but my heart has always been in
                    Colorado. My wife and I travel there as much as possible! In fact we got married in Rocky Mountain
                    National Park in September of 2021. You'll notice a theme when it comes to photos found on this website and from my past assignments. I clearly have a bias towards The Centennial State! We have 5 children! That being 4 fur babies and 1 beautiful baby boy!</p>

                <p>This is our baby boy, Mikko. He is 5 months old and has an amazing personality. He is always smiling
                    at everybody, doesn't matter who you are! He loves to swim, roll around, bounce in his bouncer, and
