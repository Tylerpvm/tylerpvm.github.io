                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hi There! Thanks for stopping by to check out my online profile! I'll start off by introducing
                    myself. My name is Tyler and I'm from Springfield Missouri. My dad's side of the family is from
                    Missouri but my mom comes from Denver Colorado. I love my home but my heart has always been in
                    Colorado so my wife and I travel there as much as possible! In fact we got married in Rocky Mountain
                    National Park in September of 2021. We have 3 cats, 1 dog, and a beautiful baby boy!</p>

                <p>This is our baby boy, Mikko. He is 5 months old and has an amazing personality. He is always smiling
                    at everybody, doesn't matter who you are! He loves to swim, roll around, bounce in his bouncer, and
                    loves his fur babies!</p>
