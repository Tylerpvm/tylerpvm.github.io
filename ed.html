                <h2>Education</h2>
                <p>I started my college career 10 years ago, with the plan to graduate with a couple different degrees
                    to start a career in environmental engineering. I had a great goal but I didn't commit to it all the
                    way. After a few semesters of making the wrong choices, I decided to change paths and work towards
                    an automotive engineering degree. Again being young and not fully committing, also exhausting all of
                    the finantial aid that was allotted to me, I had to withdraw from my classes. After that, I ended up
                    taking 5 years off and spent some time building my family. However, after the pandemic, I felt that
                    I wasn't where I wanted to be. I paid off all of what was owed on my previous classes and I decided
                    that it was time to find a career that can both set my family up for success, and one that I would
                    have a passion for. I did some research on some different paths that I could take and one stood
                    above all else. I don't have a lot of experience in computer science, but I have LOVED it so far!
                    It's definitely a challenge at times, but it's one that I am ready to take on!</p>
